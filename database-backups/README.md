# 🔒 Database Backup Files

This directory contains JSON backup files of the complete Wagh Rental Units Tracker database.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL SAFETY BACKUP ⚠️

These backups were created to protect against accidental database overwrites. Each backup contains the complete state of all database tables at the time of backup.

## 🔧 How to Restore from Backup

If database restoration is ever needed:

1. **DO NOT** use `prisma db seed` as it wipes existing data
2. Use the individual JSON files to restore specific tables
3. Import records using proper Prisma client methods
4. Verify all relationships and foreign keys

## 🛡️ Safety Protocol

**NEVER EVER** run any database reset, seed, or migration commands without:
1. Creating a fresh backup first
2. Getting explicit user confirmation twice
3. Verifying the backup contains the expected number of records

## 📅 Backup Schedule

Backups should be created:
- Before any database schema changes
- Before running any seed or migration scripts
- Before any bulk data operations
- Regularly as part of maintenance

## 🔍 Backup Verification

To verify a backup is complete:
- Check the summary file for expected record counts
- Ensure all JSON files are present and non-empty
- Verify relationships between tables are preserved
